"""Special singleton markers used to modify values in PersiDict without data payload.

This module defines two singleton flags used as "joker" values when writing to
persistent dictionaries:

- KEEP_CURRENT: keep the current value unchanged.
- DELETE_CURRENT: delete the current value if it exists.

These flags are intended to be passed as the value part in dict-style
assignments (e.g., d[key] = KEEP_CURRENT) and are interpreted by PersiDict
implementations.

Examples:
    >>> from persidict.singletons import KEEP_CURRENT, DELETE_CURRENT
    >>> d[key] = KEEP_CURRENT  # Do not alter existing value
    >>> d[key] = DELETE_CURRENT  # Remove key if present
